# QSIL-Language
Quick, Self-Interpreting Language, or "Random Project for my Boredom"

This is a (hopefully) self-interpreting language that should, after some more development, be capable of compiling its own bytecodes for itself. To get it running, download the code, and in a terminal (or cmd for windows users), type:

    python qsil.py

Right now, all this does is print gradually increasing numbers, and not much else, but it saves the state between each run and is able to continue from where it left off, in a "live" environment. If you feel comfortable, you can go ahead and try to help me develop this by forking this repository and submitting a pull request. To see what I am hoping to get done soon, check out issue #1 and see what you can help out with!
